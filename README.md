This was my first attempt at making a random floor generator.  I did it in C# since it’s one of the languages I’m most comfortable with so I could focus logic of the program.  I have adapted this code to work in an Unity project that I’m working on for my Advance Game Development.  I have also implemented it in a Godot game I'm working on for mobile platforms.
